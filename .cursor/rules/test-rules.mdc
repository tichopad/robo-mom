- Test files are placed next to the source files they test with `.test.ts` extension
- Use Node.js built-in test runner (node:test) for all tests
- Test both positive and negative cases (with and without context)
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario being tested
- Group related tests using `describe()` blocks for better organization
- Test error conditions and edge cases, not just happy paths
- Test concurrent scenarios to ensure proper isolation
- Use `t.plan()` when testing async operations to ensure all assertions run
- Prefer `t.assert` over direct `assert` calls for better test runner integration
- Test both synchronous and asynchronous scenarios
- Verify cleanup and isolation after exceptions or errors
- Avoid mocking dependencies unless absolutely necessary - rather write the code to be testable
